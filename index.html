        <p><strong>Plot: </strong> greed, betrayal and vengeance set the stage for this Sir Arthur Conan Doyle classic. Mary Morstan, a young governess, has been receiving a rare and lustrous pearl annually from an anonymous benefactor. This mysterious person now wants a meeting. Anxious and bewildered, Miss Morstan asks Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to escort her to this meeting. Together they go to the home of an eccentric man, Thaddeus Sholto, who tells them that his father, Major Sholto, was in the army in India with Miss Morstan’s father where the two had come to possess a fabulous treasure. Subsequently, her father mysteriously disappeared without his promised share. A guilt-ridden Major Sholto hid the treasure. Years later, Major Sholto receives a letter which leaves him in a state of shock and despair, but he dies before being able to reveal its contents or the location of the treasure to his sons. Thaddeus’ twin brother, Bartholomew, spends weeks digging and searching for the treasure – and has finally just found it…</p>
        <p><strong>My opinion:</strong> I started this book and then I found out that I had already read it. I decided to finish it even because I wanted to practice my English, and I really liked it: I love Sherlock Holmes’ books but in English, in Italian they bore me, I had already discovered it when I read “A study in scarlet”. <br>
The translations of a book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle bore me. I mean, I appreciate the creativity of the author and the skill of Holmes but they don’t really catch me and they don’t make me feel like I’m in the nineteenth-century London. <strong>For the non-English readers:</strong>  these books aren’t particularly difficult, even if I’ve just found out that they’re B2/B2.1 levels, because the author uses mainly a modern language. Of course there are some ancient or interesting words (like “to-day” and “to-morrow” instead of “today” and “tomorrow”) but I was amused by this peculiarities.< br>
By the way, I really enjoyed this book because when I read it again (I didn’t remember very well the details like the reason of the murder or the chain which brought Holmes and Watson to the culprit) I watched in a different way all the moves and the ideas Sherlock Holmes had.<br>
Now I’m reading a collection of short novels about Doyle’s detective (how can’t I love him?) and I don’t really know if I like more books or short novels: these novels are quicker, based on Sherlock Holmes’ logic and line of reasoning, with less room for clues and stakeouts. The books are the opposite: all the details are explained, and there is more room for all the conversations between Watson and Holmes and for the confessions of the criminals.
</p>
      <p><strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> omg I remembered about Watson and Mary! Even if I liked more Watson at Baker Street, Mary is so sweet.<br>
      By the way in every book/short novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle I read I am more amazed by how good is the TV show "Sherlock". I mean- Mary is Mary!!! But in the TV show she was so hateful.

        <p><strong>Quotes: </strong><br>
"My mind," he said, "rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation." <br>
"Eliminate all other factors and the which remains must be the truth."<br>
"What is the use of having powers, Doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth."
